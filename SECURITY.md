# Security

**Responsible use:** This project is for educational purposes. Do not use it for unauthorized access or to attack systems you do not own.

**Responsible disclosure:** If you find a vulnerability in this code, please open an issue or contact the maintainer privately. Provide steps to reproduce and a suggested fix.

**Sensitive data:** Do not include real passwords, hashes tied to real accounts, or personal data in the repository or examples.

**Usage constraints:** Use wordlists and targets only when you have explicit permission. Misuse may be illegal.

**Contributions:** Do not submit code that automates attacks against third-party services, or that intentionally bypasses security controls.

**Hardening tips:**

* Validate and sanitize inputs if adding network or parsing features.
* Avoid embedding secrets in code. Use environment variables for any credentials.
* Add rate limiting and user confirmation before performing large-scale operations.

**License & legal:** The author is not responsible for misuse. Follow local laws and obtain permission before testing.
